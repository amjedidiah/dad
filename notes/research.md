### Buy box

> for his books and audio messages

- First write out what your product is and what it does.
- Then, bullet out the unique benefits, which can speak to the pain points you’re trying to solve or the gap you’re looking to fill in the market.
- Opting to include everything in the buy box? Consider adding a toggle option, like Brightland does for its olive oils, and further explore product benefits there.

![Buy box](/images/buy-box.png)

- Add customer testimonials, that directly speak to a benefit or pain point each product solves at the top of the box in place of the item name:

![Buy box with testimonials](/images/buy-box-with-customer-review.png)

- Dedicate a section on the same page to show more reviews(that links from the review at the top as well)
- Include a star rating: consider adding in the number of reviews next to the stars too.
